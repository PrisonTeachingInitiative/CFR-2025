Hi Na'eem! Here's your data! 

You have one file for each redshift. I got your redshifts 0, 0.26, 0.44, 0.68, 0.82, and 1. There were too many galaxies to get you all of them, so I did a random selection of 10,000 at each redshift.

If the time since last major merger is 13.8, it means that galaxy has never had a major merger.

New files!

You now have the time since last major merger, stellar mass of the galaxy, and SFR for all galaxies with a stellar mass between 10^8 and 10^12 Msun for z=0 and z=1
