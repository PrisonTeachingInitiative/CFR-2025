Hi Daniel! Here's your data. Each file has SFR and metallicity for all of the galaxies that have a stellar mass between 10^8.57 and 10^8.66 Msun. There's a file for each redshift. I got your redshifts 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.4, and 3. (I don't know why they don't have a 2.5, so 2.4 is as close as I could get.)

New data!! 

Same mass cut. Now this is metal mass for stars and gas.

For all of the data, you will need to create a function where you calculate abundance from the raw metal mass and raw hydrogen data. Below are the following steps

1. Divide the metal data column by the hydrogen star/gas data column
2. Multiply by 1.008 and divide by the amu of the element
3. Take log10 of the result. (I suggest you use np.log10)
4. Add 12 to it
You now have 12 + log[metal/H]
